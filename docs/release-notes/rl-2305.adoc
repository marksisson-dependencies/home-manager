== Release 23.05

This is the current unstable branch and the information in this section is therefore not final.

[[sec-release-23.05-highlights]]
=== Highlights

This release has the following notable changes:

* Firefox add-ons are now managed per-profile.
That is, if you are currently having
+
[source,nix]
programs.firefox.extensions = [ foo bar ];
+
in your configuration then you must change it to
+
[source,nix]
programs.firefox.profiles.myprofile.extensions = [ foo bar ];

* The `home-manager` tool now offers an `init` command.
This command can be used to generate an initial Home Manager configuration,
and optionally also activate it.
The recommended installation method for a standalone Home Manager setup
with Nix flakes uses this new command.
See <<sec-flakes-standalone-unstable>> for more.

=== State Version Changes

The state version in this release includes the changes below.
These changes are only active if the `home.stateVersion` option is set to "23.05" or later.

* The <<opt-xsession.windowManager.i3.config.window.titlebar>>,
<<opt-xsession.windowManager.i3.config.floating.titlebar>>,
<<opt-wayland.windowManager.sway.config.window.titlebar>>,
<<opt-wayland.windowManager.sway.config.floating.titlebar>>, options now default to `true` which
is consistent with the default values for those options used by `i3` and `sway`.
